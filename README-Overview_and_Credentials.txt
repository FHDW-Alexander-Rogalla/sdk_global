This project expects you to clone the GIT repository and follow the instructions in the README-files of each repository. For Startup docker is needed as a container-service.

The tech stack is as follows:

Frontend - Angular
|
API - .NET 9.0 SDK
|
Database - Supabase


Global: https://github.com/FHDW-Alexander-Rogalla/sdk_global
Frontend-Repo-URL: https://github.com/FHDW-Alexander-Rogalla/sdk_ec_frontend
API-Repo-URL: https://github.com/FHDW-Alexander-Rogalla/sdk_ec_backend_api



Both have the option to either choose HTTP or HTTPS for running the applications. Look into the README for that.
Depending on the HTTP/HTTPS-mode, the routes have to be configured in the frontend in file (HTTP by default):
sdk_ec_frontend\ec_frontend\src\environments\environment.ts
